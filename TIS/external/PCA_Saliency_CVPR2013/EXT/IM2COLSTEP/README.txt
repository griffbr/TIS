SMALLbox is a MATLAB Evaluation Framework for the EU FET-OPEN Project, no: 225913:
Sparse Models, Algorithms, and Learning for Large-scale data (SMALL). 

The project team includes researchers from the following institutions:

INRIA:                            http://www.irisa.fr/metiss/gribonval/
University of Edinburgh:          http://www.see.ed.ac.uk/~mdavies4/
Queen Mary, University of London: http://www.elec.qmul.ac.uk/people/markp/
EPFL:                             http://people.epfl.ch/pierre.vandergheynst
Technion:                         http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~elad/

will download and install the following existing toolboxes 
related to Sparse Representations, Compressed Sensing and Dictionary Learning:


-	SPARCO (v.1.2) - set of sparse representation problems[5]
-	SparseLab (v.2.1) - set of sparse solvers [1]
-	Sparsify (v.0.4) - set of greedy and hard thresholding algorithms [2]
-	SPGL1 (v.1.7) - large-scale sparse reconstruction solver [3]
-	GPSR (v.6.0) - Gradient projection for sparse reconstruction [4]
-	KSVD-box (v.13) and OMP-box (v.10) - dictionary learning [6]
-	KSVDS-box (v.11) and OMPS-box (v.1) - sparse dictionary learning [7]. 



IMPORTANT:
In order to use SparseLab please register at
http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/sparselab/cgi-bin/register.pl

IMPORTANT:
To successfully install all toolboxes you will need to have MEX setup to compile C files.
If this is not already setup, run "mex -setup" or type "help mex" in the MATLAB command prompt.

IMPORTANT:
Because the toolboxes are downloaded automatically, you must have an internet connection
to successfully install SMALLbox.

IMPORTANT:
If you are running Matlab on MAC OSX or Linux, you must start Matlab with the jvm enabled.
Not doing so, will prevent you being able to unzip the downloaded toolboxes.

To install the toolbox run the command "SMALLboxsetup" from the MATLAB command prompt.

Once installed, there are two optional demo functions that can be run:

Example test of solvers from different toolboxes on Sparco compressed sensing problems and
Example test of dictionary learning techniques on image denoising problems

Further examples can be found in {SMALLbox root}/examples directory
